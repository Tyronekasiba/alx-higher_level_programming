Python - Classes and Objects

A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and behavior. It allows you to organize and structure your code in a way that is more efficient, maintainable, and scalable.

Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects. Just as a blueprint provides a set of instructions for building a house, a class provides a set of instructions for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors.

a method is a function that is associated with an object. It is a behavior or an action that an object can perform. Methods are defined inside a class, and they operate on the attributes of the object that the method is called on.

In simpler terms, a method is a function that is defined inside a class and is used to perform some operation on an object of that class.
