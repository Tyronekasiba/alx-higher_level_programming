## Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
## Python ORM

This repository contains a Python Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a convenient and intuitive way to interact with relational databases using Python. The ORM simplifies the process of mapping database tables to Python objects, allowing developers to work with databases using familiar object-oriented programming paradigms.

## Features
Database Connectivity: Connect to various relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more.
Table Mapping: Automatically map database tables to Python classes, providing an easy way to interact with the database.
CRUD Operations: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database using simple Python methods.
Query Building: Construct complex database queries using a high-level API.
Relationships: Define and manage relationships between tables, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.
Transactions: Support for transactional operations to ensure data consistency.
Schema Migrations: Perform database schema migrations and keep the database schema in sync with the application's models

## Getting Started
To get started with the Python ORM library, follow these steps:

Import the ORM module into your Python script:


from orm import Database, Model, Field
Create a database connection by initializing the Database class:


db = Database('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')
Define a model class by subclassing the Model class:


class User(Model):
    __table__ = 'users'
    id = Field(primary_key=True)
    name = Field()
    email = Field(unique=True)
Perform various database operations using the model:


# Create a new user
user = User(name='John Doe', email='john.doe@example.com')
user.save()

# Query users
users = User.select().where(User.name == 'John Doe')

# Update a user
user.name = 'Jane Smith'
user.save()

# Delete a user
user.delete()
For more information and detailed usage examples, please refer to the documentation.
