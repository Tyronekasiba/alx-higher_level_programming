"""WHA IS DOCTEST"""

Doctest is a tool in Python that allows you to write tests for your code in a way that is both easy to read and easy to understand. When you write code, it's important to make sure that it works correctly and produces the expected results. Testing your code can help you catch bugs and errors before they cause problems.

Doctest allows you to write tests in your code's docstrings. Docstrings are special strings that come immediately after a function or class definition that provide documentation about the code.
