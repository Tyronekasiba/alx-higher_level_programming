Exceptions in python


In Python, exceptions and errors are used to handle unexpected situations that may arise during program execution.

An exception is a runtime error that occurs when a statement or expression cannot be executed properly. Python provides a mechanism to handle exceptions through the try-except statement. You can use this statement to enclose code that may raise an exception, and provide a block of code to handle the exception if it is raised.
