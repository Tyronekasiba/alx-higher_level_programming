python inheritance



Python inheritance is a feature that allows a new class to be based on an existing class. The new class, called a subclass, inherits the properties and methods of the existing class, called a superclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse and abstraction, making it easier to create complex programs. There are different types of inheritance, including single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance.
